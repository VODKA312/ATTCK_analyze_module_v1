## First step
results -> 90% train 10% test
## Second step
90% -> clustering -> json cluser_data_train_pre0_cutoff4.json -> generate Technique to Technique relationship datasheet

## Third Step
select test datasheet -> select one specific technique in test datasheet -> 
inference other technique through Technique to Technique relationship datasheet -> match in original test datasheet.
